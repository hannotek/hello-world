Greetings to any who read this.

I am hannotek, real name is Robert.
Hannotek is my Korean name, but I am not Korean.
The name was given to me by an old Korean lady during one of my tours in South Korea.
It means "curiously intelligent". 
It sounds like a compliment, but I'm not sure.
I have eight kids.
I drink a lot of coffee. Black Rifle Coffee or nothing.
